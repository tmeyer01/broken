        <p>Decipher, break and penetrate the code. Encrypted secret message is everyone's favorite especially when a treasure box is involved.</p>
        <p>As a warm up, try solving the featured puzzle at the top. Look carefully at the title. Hmm, maybe you have one hanging on the wall right now? Sort them in order and you've solved the first cryptogram on this page!</p>
        <p>Now, Look at the three puzzles on the right (or at the bottom of the page, if you are viewing this page with a mobile device) with three numbers. It may look puzzling to you. But it is very simple and even elementary school kids can solve this easily. The hint to solve this puzzle is hidden in the one below it. Now this one is a typical "cryptogram".</p> 

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <!-- start of excerpt from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram -->
        <p>A cryptogram is a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted text<a class="inline" href="sources.html"><sup>[See source]</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>Generally the cipher used to encrypt the text is simple enough that the cryptogram can be solved by hand. Frequently used are substitution ciphers where each letter is replaced by a different letter or number. </p>
        <p>To solve the puzzle, you need to recover the original lettering. Though once used in more serious applications, they are now mainly printed for entertainment in newspapers and magazines.</p>

        <p>Other types of classical ciphers are sometimes used to create cryptograms. An example is the book cipher where a book or article is used to encrypt a message.</p>
